## Objective

The main objective of this project is to create an API to manage clients and the loan payments control system.

## Purpose

We are trying to ensure financial inclusion by supporting SMES ensuring that they have access to credit to scale their businesses. 

## Problem
	
A fin-tech needs to create and manage the clients and keep track of the amount of money loaned and the missed/made payments. It also needs a place to retrieve the volume of outstanding debt at some point in time.We need to leverage on ai for credit scoring

## Business Rules

- If a client contracted a loan in the past and paid all without missing any payment, then his limit can be increased.
- If a client contracted a loan in the past and has been delaying payment,then then reduce the loan limit that customer can access.
- If a client contracted a loan in the past and paid all but missed more than 3 weekly payments or didnâ€™t pay all the loan, you need to deny the new one.
The interest rate for the loan  should be placed at 20% 
 A loan processing fee of 1%

## Limitations

Loans are paid back in weekly instalments.
